// check-writeback-currency.mjs — did the last working session actually write back?
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES (S272, found live).
// Every pre-existing coherence probe compares surface against surface:
//   · closeout-session-coherence — status must not CLAIM more than the surfaces contain
//   · session-number-freshness   — PROJECT_STATUS must not LAG SIL/handoff
// Both are satisfied when every surface agrees at S<n>. Neither can see the
// opposite failure: the surfaces agree with each other and are all equally
// WRONG, because real work landed in git afterwards and closeout never ran.
//
// That is exactly what happened after S269: two working blocks (186 files,
// +38k lines — Studio Ops Console v1, CANON-054/055, CANON-053 bypass fixes,
// twin alwaysApprove, sanitize-by-content) were committed and pushed, but the
// closeout write-back never executed. Tree stayed clean, every surface still
// said S269, every coherence probe stayed green, and the drift was invisible.
//
// So this probe measures surfaces against GIT REALITY instead.
//
// ANCHOR CHOICE (deliberate): the newest commit touching
// context/SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md. SIL is append-only and written exactly once
// per closeout, which makes it the only true closeout fingerprint. Do NOT anchor
// on PROJECT_STATUS.json — the live incident had a test-receipt-only commit
// (`chore(proof): S271 full-suite receipt`) touching PROJECT_STATUS without a
// closeout, which would have laundered the debt into a false green.
//
// Exit: 0 = current (or in-flight) · 1 = write-back debt.
