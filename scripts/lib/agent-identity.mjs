// Agent identity resolution (S271) — the missing dimension in cross-repo provenance.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// Both durable provenance planes record WHICH REPO acted, never WHICH AGENT:
//   · Ark cargo   `{ from, to }`  are repo slugs. No agent field at all.
//   · Obelisk receipts `actor`    was 'studio-ops' on 4,164 of 4,176 receipts.
// So "what did Codex touch vs Claude Code" was unanswerable from either ledger,
// even though `context/.session-lock` has carried `agent:` the whole time. The
// identity existed at the source and was dropped before the write.
//
// THE HONESTY RULE (CANON-031)
// This module NEVER guesses. If the agent cannot be established from a real
// signal it returns `agent: null` with `source: 'unresolved'`. A fabricated
// 'claude-code' default would poison the exact attribution the ledgers exist to
// provide — and would be indistinguishable from a real reading. Consumers must
// render unresolved as UNATTRIBUTED, never as a name and never as a zero.
//
// Resolution order (first real signal wins):
//   1. explicit argument      — caller knows (e.g. a broker executing for a lane)
//   2. $STUDIO_AGENT          — set by non-Claude harnesses / CI lanes
//   3. context/.session-lock  — written by scripts/write-session-lock.mjs
//   4. unresolved             — null, honestly
import fs from 'node:fs';
import path from 'node:path';

// Agents we mint identities for. An unrecognized value is still RECORDED (we do
// not silently drop a real signal) but is flagged so a typo'd lane is visible
// rather than quietly becoming its own permanent identity in the ledger.
