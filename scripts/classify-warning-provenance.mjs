/**
 * classify-warning-provenance.mjs — S168 #2. The meta-honesty turn.
 *
 * The observability-honesty arc (S144 "no lying surfaces" → S167 "turn the lens
 * on the doctor itself") had one unexamined assumption: that a doctor warning
 * means STUDIO-OPS has debt. Often it doesn't — brand/deploy/free-tier/registry-
 * drift/obelisk are portfolio-adoption signals 35 sibling sessions own. Showing
 * them as undifferentiated yellow on the control-plane board is a CANON-031
 * honesty defect at the meta level: it conflates "I have unfinished work" with
 * "I am the dashboard for work other repos owe."
 *
 * This module tags every non-green probe by owner ∈ {self, sibling, chronic} via
 * portfolio/WARNING_PROVENANCE.json, so the board can say
 *   "N warnings · S self · X sibling · C chronic"
 * instead of one anxious yellow.
 *
 * HONESTY GUARDS (the teeth — non-redundant with check-probe-honesty, which
 * checks the REMEDY map; this checks the PROVENANCE map):
 *   1. An UNMAPPED non-green probe defaults to `self` (fail-honest — never assume
 *      someone else's problem).
 *   2. You may NOT map an auto-healable probe (in doctor-remedies HEAL_MAP) to
 *      sibling/chronic — that is hiding self-fixable debt behind another name.
 *   3. A `chronic` entry past its reviewBy re-surfaces as a live concern.
 * Violations of 2/3 make the doctor meta-probe fail. sibling/chronic that are
 * correctly mapped only INFORM — they never red the board.
 *
 * Static + non-recursive: the doctor wires validateProvenanceMap() (no live
 * doctor run). The CLI breakdown reads a doctor json via --from / newest cache.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/classify-warning-provenance.mjs --json [--from <doctor.json>]
 *   node scripts/classify-warning-provenance.mjs            # human report

// ownership-classification question: a red test is FIXED, not labeled
