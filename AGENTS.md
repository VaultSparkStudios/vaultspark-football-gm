# Project Agent Guide

## Session Protocol (agent-neutral — applies to Claude Code, Codex, any agent)

The canonical execution protocol for every Studio OS session lives in **`docs/SESSION_PROTOCOL.md`** in this repo (propagated from studio-ops).

It covers the 3-command rhythm (`/start` → `/go` → `/closeout`), full protocol for 15 commands, and agent-specific notes for Claude Code + Codex. Both agents execute the same instructions; per-agent branching is flagged explicitly with `IF agent = claude-code:` / `IF agent = codex:`.

See `docs/SKILL_MAP.md` for the one-page command cheatsheet.

This public repository contains deployable project code and public-safe documentation.

Public-safe rule:
- keep deployable code and browser-safe configuration in this repo
- keep internal operating procedures, private planning, secret-handling workflows, and detailed studio process docs in the private Studio OS / ops repository

## IP and Licensing (CANON-008)

All VaultSpark Studios code, content, assets, and designs are **proprietary by default**. All rights are reserved by VaultSpark Studios LLC unless a license is explicitly declared and approved by the Studio Owner.

**Agent rules:**
- Never add a `LICENSE` file with open-source terms unless explicitly instructed by the Studio Owner
- Never label a page, readme, or doc as "open source" for VaultSpark-original work
- Attribution/compliance pages on public sites must use proprietary-first language
- `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md` default: `License: Proprietary — All Rights Reserved, VaultSpark Studios LLC`

**Exceptions (legal obligations — not discretionary):**
Any project forked from a copyleft-licensed upstream must declare its license in `context/DECISIONS.md` and `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md`. Check `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md` for this project's obligations.

Full decision: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` → CANON-008

> **This block is the studio-wide operational layer, shared by every VaultSpark repo.** It carries the gates and pointers you need resident every session. Full canon prose lives once, in `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` — the index below points into it. Don't expand canon text back into this file; keep it lean.

<!-- canon-section: hard-gates -->
## The hard gates (run before you label anything blocked)

**CANON-019 — Founder-Action Discipline. Default: try first; label blocked only with evidence.** Before any `Human Action Required` / `[BLOCKER]` / `FOUNDER ACTION` / `human-blocked` label, you MUST run + log:

```bash
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/check-secrets.mjs --for <capability>   # 1. secrets discovery (phantom-blocker = forbidden)
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/ops.mjs blocker-preflight              # 2. elevated/admin probe
# 3. credential READY → execute it yourself via the secrets gateway
# 4. admin probe reveals an agent-path → execute it
```

Reserve human-blocked **only** for: hardware-key enrollment · provider dashboard signup · billing/payment confirmation · CANON-gated destructive ops (force-push to main, npm publish, prod DB drop). **Everything else is agent work** — apply scripted migrations/deploys/secret-puts yourself (`wrangler deploy`, `wrangler secret put`, `gh secret set`, `gcloud …`, `node scripts/migrate-*.mjs --apply`). The founder-twin auto-approves safe patterns; deny patterns still gate at the founder.

<!-- canon-section: secrets -->
## Secrets gateway (CANON-012)

All Studio credentials live in **`vaultspark-studio-ops/secrets/`** — every project, every agent reads from there. Never read `.env` directly in subprocesses; never assume `process.env.X` is set.

```js
import { getSecret, resolveCapability, redact } from 'vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/lib/secrets.mjs';
const key = await getSecret('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', 'stripe.checkout');
console.log(redact(`Using ${key}`));
```

Capability → env-var names: `vaultspark-studio-ops/secrets/CAPABILITY_MAP.json`. MISSING credential → `/intake-credentials`. Never print raw secrets (`redact()` everything). Stripe Agent Payments (autonomous spend w/ cap): capability `stripe.agent-payments`. Full: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/SECRETS_PROTOCOL.md`.

<!-- canon-section: founder-twin -->
<!-- canon-section: broad-approval -->
## Founder-Twin — shared cross-agent approval brain (CANON-024)

One shared auto-approval model across Claude Code, Codex, and managed agents — patterns learned by one benefit all. **Claude Code:** wired via `~/.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse hook. **Codex/other:** call before risky commands — `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/twin-ask.mjs Bash "<command>"` (exit 0=approve · 1=ask · 2=deny). Prefer one bounded command-family approval over piecemeal asks; never request broad approval for destructive/arbitrary-interpreter/`curl|sh`/heredoc/secret/force-push/publish/prod-destructive/billing/legal actions. Before any side-effecting/networked/privileged/cross-repo/payment/secret action verify: intent · scope (recursive ops resolve inside the intended dir) · trust (package-trust) · secrets-gateway-only · blast-radius+rollback · twin-verdict. Disable per-session: `export TWIN_DISABLED=1`. Spec: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/TWIN_PROTOCOL.md`.

<!-- canon-section: package-trust -->
## Package trust (CANON-023)

Before any `npm/pnpm/yarn/pip/cargo install`, `curl | sh`, archive/binary/model-weight download, or agent-suggested install command:

```bash
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/package-trust.mjs --package <name>@<version>
```

`BLOCK` = hard stop, pick another option. Treat raw GitHub zips, shortened URLs, installers, shell scripts, model weights, and browser extensions as quarantined until verified. After lockfile changes / before push: `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/scan-npm-supply-chain.mjs --json`. Protocol: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/OBELISK_PACKAGE_TRUST_PROTOCOL.md`.

<!-- canon-section: ark-transport -->
## Cross-repo transport — Studio Ark (CANON-018)

**Never write directly to another repo's files. Ship cargo instead.** `/start` auto-drains your inbox (the `╔══ ARK STATUS ══╗` brief tile shows depth + sig health); receipts auto-emit on drain.

```bash
node scripts/ark.mjs ship --type pattern-share --to '*' --payload '{"pattern":"...","solution":"...","tags":["..."]}'
node scripts/ark.mjs ship --type repo-question --to <slug> --payload '{"question":"...","replyTo":"my-slug"}'
node scripts/ark.mjs ship --type agent-handoff --to <slug> --payload '{"intent":"...","openFiles":["..."]}'
```

<!-- canon-section: co-authoring -->
Producer allowlist: `vaultspark-studio-ops/portfolio/ark/MANIFEST.json` (`canon-update` + `phantom-blocker-fix` are studio-ops only). Co-authoring roles (CANON-022): Designer owns source-of-truth · Mechanizer owns canon/probes/templates · Propagator owns cross-repo rollout (both studio-ops) · Implementer owns code. Design: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_ARK.md`.

<!-- canon-section: skill-discovery -->
<!-- canon-section: audit-implement -->
## Skill & capability discovery (CANON-012)

Don't know the command? Check capabilities before declaring anything unknown or blocked: master index `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/AGENT_CAPABILITIES.md` · NL lookup `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/ops.mjs cap "<intent>"` · skills `~/.claude/skills/` (Claude) / `~/.agents/skills/` (Codex) · cheatsheet `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/SKILL_MAP.md`. Universal skills: `/audit` (9-axis audit → `docs/AUDIT_<date>.md`) + `/implement` (ship the audit). No match → file an innovation candidate.

## Public-facing project requirements

For `audience: public-*` projects:
- **Sitemap (CANON-011):** every page in `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/PROJECT_SITEMAP_STANDARD.md` exists + passes bars (LCP <1.8s · CWV green · strict CSP · `/agents.json` · `/.well-known/llms.txt` · sitemap.xml). Score ≥8/10 before SPARKED. Audit: `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/check-sitemap-compliance.mjs --project <slug>`.
- **Website scaffold (D-S119.3):** before scaffolding any page, consult `vaultspark-studio-ops/portfolio/STUDIO_WEBSITE_SCAFFOLD/catalog.json` + `patterns.json`; use the consensus pattern unless SOUL justifies deviation (log in DECISIONS). Public signup → wire the Vault SSO contract (`vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/VAULT_SSO_CONTRACT.md`).
- **Enforce:** branding line per type (CANON-006), footer `© 2026 VaultSpark Studios LLC. All rights reserved.`, `/privacy` + `/terms`, acronyms spelled out on first use (CANON-030), free tier cost-neutral (CANON-029), staging before prod (CANON-007). `/app-release-gate` checks these before any SPARKED flip.

**Studio Canon — index.** Full text + rationale for every entry: **vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md** (jump to the matching `## CANON-NNN` heading). These are studio-wide defaults; you are expected to follow them. Read the full entry before acting on anything you're unsure about, and before changing canon, public promises, rights, licenses, launch dates, or security/data handling.
