// doctor-score-coherence.mjs — guard the cached doctorScore the startup brief
// surfaces against cross-session staleness (S173 [audit #2]).
//
// Background: the SIGNALS box in the startup brief reads `status.doctorScore`
// from PROJECT_STATUS.json. Historically the brief's doctor preflight ran
// `doctor --fix` WITHOUT `--update-json`, so the displayed score was whatever
// the PRIOR session's closeout persisted. When a probe self-healed between
// sessions (propagation-adoption fail→warn) the brief kept surfacing a phantom
// ⛔ "N failing" the live doctor no longer agreed with — a CANON-031 lie on the
// studio's most-read surface.
//
// This lib is deliberately a pure, testable pair of predicates rather than a
// live doctor probe: a probe reading the very score the doctor writes is one
// run behind by construction (the score is persisted AFTER runChecks()), which
// would reintroduce the self-referential staleness-phantom class S167–S170
// worked to eliminate. The guard therefore lives in a deterministic tier test
// that asserts (a) the renderer's preflight still refreshes the score, and
// (b) the behavioral invariant that a render leaves the score same-day fresh.

// S266 ([SIL:1][S259 #2]) — midnight-stable freshness. Day-identity comparison
// fabricated a stale-red at every UTC rollover (00:00 UTC = 8pm founder-local):
// a score persisted 23:59 read "stale by 1d" one minute later. Freshness is a
// bounded AGE, not a calendar identity — prefer the full-resolution `ranAt`
// (persisted since S174) and compare hours; day-identity survives only as the
// legacy fallback for scores predating `ranAt`.
