# Project Agent Guide

## Session Protocol (agent-neutral — applies to Claude Code, Codex, any agent)

The canonical execution protocol for every Studio OS session lives in **`docs/SESSION_PROTOCOL.md`** in this repo (propagated from studio-ops).

It covers the 3-command rhythm (`/start` → `/go` → `/closeout`), full protocol for 15 commands, and agent-specific notes for Claude Code + Codex. Both agents execute the same instructions; per-agent branching is flagged explicitly with `IF agent = claude-code:` / `IF agent = codex:`.

See `docs/SKILL_MAP.md` for the one-page command cheatsheet.

This public repository contains deployable project code and public-safe documentation.

Public-safe rule:
- keep deployable code and browser-safe configuration in this repo
- keep internal operating procedures, private planning, secret-handling workflows, and detailed studio process docs in the private Studio OS / ops repository

## IP and Licensing (CANON-008)

All VaultSpark Studios code, content, assets, and designs are **proprietary by default**. All rights are reserved by VaultSpark Studios LLC unless a license is explicitly declared and approved by the Studio Owner.

**Agent rules:**
- Never add a `LICENSE` file with open-source terms unless explicitly instructed by the Studio Owner
- Never label a page, readme, or doc as "open source" for VaultSpark-original work
- Attribution/compliance pages on public sites must use proprietary-first language
- `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md` default: `License: Proprietary — All Rights Reserved, VaultSpark Studios LLC`

**Exceptions (legal obligations — not discretionary):**
Any project forked from a copyleft-licensed upstream must declare its license in `context/DECISIONS.md` and `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md`. Check `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md` for this project's obligations.

Full decision: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` → CANON-008

> **This block is the studio-wide operational layer, shared by every VaultSpark repo.** It carries the gates and pointers you need resident every session. Full canon prose lives once, in `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` — the index below points into it. Don't expand canon text back into this file; keep it lean.

<!-- canon-section: hard-gates -->
## The hard gates (run before you label anything blocked)

**CANON-019 — Founder-Action Discipline. Default: try first; label blocked only with evidence.** Before any `Human Action Required` / `[BLOCKER]` / `FOUNDER ACTION` / `human-blocked` label, you MUST run + log:

```bash
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/check-secrets.mjs --for <capability>   # 1. secrets discovery (phantom-blocker = forbidden)
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/ops.mjs blocker-preflight              # 2. elevated/admin probe
# 3. credential READY → execute it yourself via the secrets gateway
# 4. admin probe reveals an agent-path → execute it
```

Reserve human-blocked **only** for: hardware-key enrollment · provider dashboard signup · billing/payment confirmation · CANON-gated destructive ops (force-push to main, npm publish, prod DB drop). **Everything else is agent work** — apply scripted migrations/deploys/secret-puts yourself (`wrangler deploy`, `wrangler secret put`, `gh secret set`, `gcloud …`, `node scripts/migrate-*.mjs --apply`). The founder-twin auto-approves safe patterns; deny patterns still gate at the founder.

<!-- canon-section: canon-conformance -->
## Canon conformance — know which canon apply to YOU (CANON-046 · D-S193.1)

Canon is **self-checking per project**, not a wall of rules you skim. At `/start` (and any time you're unsure), resolve which canon apply to this project, at what tier, and where you have gaps:

```bash
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/check-canon-conformance.mjs --project . --offline
```

It reads `vaultspark-studio-ops/portfolio/CANON_MATRIX.json` (tier + applicability per canon, CANON-046) against the LIVE `docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` and classifies each applicable canon: **conformed/gap** (live per-project checkers) · **doctor-owned** · **portfolio** · **manual** (judgment canon, with a reason) · **unmeasured** (no automated check yet — an actionable coverage gap). An **ABSOLUTE-tier gap is a hard stop**; STRONG gaps need a one-line justification in `DECISIONS.md`. Full canon prose + tiers: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md`; the machine-readable applicability matrix: `vaultspark-studio-ops/portfolio/CANON_MATRIX.json`.

<!-- canon-section: secrets -->
## Secrets gateway (CANON-012)

All Studio credentials live in **`vaultspark-studio-ops/secrets/`** — every project, every agent reads from there. Never read `.env` directly in subprocesses; never assume `process.env.X` is set.

```js
import { getSecret, resolveCapability, redact } from 'vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/lib/secrets.mjs';
const key = await getSecret('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', 'stripe.checkout');
console.log(redact(`Using ${key}`));
```

Capability → env-var names: `vaultspark-studio-ops/secrets/CAPABILITY_MAP.json`. MISSING credential → `/intake-credentials`. Never print raw secrets (`redact()` everything). Stripe Agent Payments (autonomous spend w/ cap): capability `stripe.agent-payments`. Full: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/SECRETS_PROTOCOL.md`.

<!-- canon-section: founder-twin -->
<!-- canon-section: broad-approval -->
## Founder-Twin — shared cross-agent approval brain (CANON-024)

One shared auto-approval model across Claude Code, Codex, and managed agents — patterns learned by one benefit all. **Claude Code:** wired via `~/.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse hook. **Codex (native, S219):** `<repo>/.codex/hooks.json` + `.codex/hooks/pre-tool-use-twin.mjs` (propagated template `codex-hooks/`) map twin verdicts to PreToolUse allow/deny; ask defers to normal prompts. **Older builds / other CLIs:** call before risky commands — `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/twin-ask.mjs Bash "<command>"` (exit 0=approve · 1=ask · 2=deny). Prefer one bounded command-family approval over piecemeal asks; never request broad approval for destructive/arbitrary-interpreter/`curl|sh`/heredoc/secret/force-push/publish/prod-destructive/billing/legal actions. Before any side-effecting/networked/privileged/cross-repo/payment/secret action verify: intent · scope (recursive ops resolve inside the intended dir) · trust (package-trust) · secrets-gateway-only · blast-radius+rollback · twin-verdict. Disable per-session: `export TWIN_DISABLED=1`. Spec: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/TWIN_PROTOCOL.md`.

## Windows Git storm guard (Codex/Windows)

On Windows, Git must be non-interactive under agent control. Run `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/install-git-window-guard.mjs --apply` at `/start` (or local `node scripts/install-git-window-guard.mjs --apply` when present). It idempotently sets user-env guard variables for future Codex/shell processes; Studio scripts additionally inherit the same guard through `scripts/lib/safe-spawn.mjs` + `windows-hide-shim.cjs`. Symptoms this prevents: repeated `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe` windows, credential helper prompts, commit-editor windows during rebase/commit, and pager focus stealing.

<!-- canon-section: package-trust -->
## Package trust (CANON-023)

Before any `npm/pnpm/yarn/pip/cargo install`, `curl | sh`, archive/binary/model-weight download, or agent-suggested install command:

```bash
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/package-trust.mjs --package <name>@<version>
```

`BLOCK` = hard stop, pick another option. Treat raw GitHub zips, shortened URLs, installers, shell scripts, model weights, and browser extensions as quarantined until verified. After lockfile changes / before push: `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/scan-npm-supply-chain.mjs --json`. Protocol: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/OBELISK_PACKAGE_TRUST_PROTOCOL.md`.

<!-- canon-section: ark-transport -->
## Cross-repo transport — Studio Ark (CANON-018)

**Never write directly to another repo's files. Ship cargo instead.** `/start` auto-drains your inbox (the `╔══ ARK STATUS ══╗` brief tile shows depth + sig health); receipts auto-emit on drain.

```bash
node scripts/ark.mjs ship --type pattern-share --to '*' --payload '{"pattern":"...","solution":"...","tags":["..."]}'
node scripts/ark.mjs ship --type repo-question --to <slug> --payload '{"question":"...","replyTo":"my-slug"}'
node scripts/ark.mjs ship --type agent-handoff --to <slug> --payload '{"intent":"...","openFiles":["..."]}'
```

<!-- canon-section: co-authoring -->
Producer allowlist: `vaultspark-studio-ops/portfolio/ark/MANIFEST.json` (`canon-update` + `phantom-blocker-fix` are studio-ops only). Co-authoring roles (CANON-022): Designer owns source-of-truth · Mechanizer owns canon/probes/templates · Propagator owns cross-repo rollout (both studio-ops) · Implementer owns code. Design: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_ARK.md`.

<!-- canon-section: skill-discovery -->
<!-- canon-section: audit-implement -->
## Skill & capability discovery (CANON-012)

Don't know the command? Check capabilities before declaring anything unknown or blocked: master index `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/AGENT_CAPABILITIES.md` · NL lookup `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/ops.mjs cap "<intent>"` · skills `~/.claude/skills/` (Claude) / `~/.agents/skills/` (Codex) · cheatsheet `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/SKILL_MAP.md`. Universal skills: `/audit` (9-axis audit → `docs/AUDIT_<date>.md`) + `/implement` (ship the audit). No match → file an innovation candidate.

**Before building any tool, check the reuse-registry (CANON-039 · Internal-First):** `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/INTERNAL_TOOLS.md` is the studio-wide registry of already-built internal tools (arc/guard/propagation/secrets/Ark/doctor and more). Reuse an existing internal tool before researching OSS or building new; only build when the registry has no fit and OSS research comes up short. Record a new reusable tool back to the registry so the next project finds it.

## Public-facing project requirements

For `audience: public-*` projects:
- **Sitemap (CANON-011):** every page in `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/PROJECT_SITEMAP_STANDARD.md` exists + passes bars (LCP <1.8s · CWV green · strict CSP · `/agents.json` · `/.well-known/llms.txt` · sitemap.xml). Score ≥8/10 before SPARKED. Audit: `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/check-sitemap-compliance.mjs --project <slug>`.
- **Website scaffold (D-S119.3 · RECOMMENDATION, not a mandate — D-S183.2):** consult `vaultspark-studio-ops/portfolio/STUDIO_WEBSITE_SCAFFOLD/catalog.json` + `patterns.json` as a **recommended starting library** to draw from and elevate per your SOUL — not a strict "only-use-this". Note deviations in DECISIONS so the catalog learns. Make menus/page names/themes/schemas/stack **as project-specific as possible** and keep exploring better options (**CANON-049** — never static). Whatever you start from must clear the elite bar:
  - Start visual implementation from the scaffold's semantic theme layer when useful: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/templates/project-system/website-theme-tokens.css` + `patterns.json` theme recipes, then adapt colors/assets to the project's own brand kit.
  - **CANON-041** desktop↔mobile parity + genuinely impressive UI/UX (scrollable 100dvh mobile drawer, never a broken/sticky menu — the pattern is the floor, not the finish).
  - **CANON-047** theme toggle (≥ dark + light + optional project themes, each a human-best palette tied to branding) — **AI image-test every theme** (screenshot pages/panels/modals; no black-on-black / light-on-white / sub-WCAG-AA; blocking in `/app-release-gate`).
  - **CANON-048** dual-audience: built for Humans AND AI Agents (`/agents.json` + `/.well-known/llms.txt` + JSON-LD + Obelisk agent auth) + AI-search-first (GEO/AEO alongside SEO).
  - **CANON-045** Obelisk identity plane — public signup/auth wires Obelisk for ONE studio account across every project + human/agent receipts (Vault SSO contract folding into Obelisk; target Obelisk).
- **Enforce (legal/IP complete):** branding line per type (CANON-006), footer `© 2026 VaultSpark Studios LLC. All rights reserved.`, proprietary/all-rights-reserved notice (CANON-008), `/privacy` + `/terms`, acronyms spelled out on first use (CANON-030), free tier cost-neutral (CANON-029), staging before prod (CANON-007). `/app-release-gate` checks these before any SPARKED flip.
- **Contact page + working email (D-S194.1 · MUST · public sites):** every project with a public website ships a `/contact` page with a **working email on the project's own domain** that **forwards/copies to `founder@vaultsparkstudios.com`**. Email infra is **Brevo** (studio-ops secrets capability `brevo`): configure a Brevo inbound/forward route for the project domain → `founder@vaultsparkstudios.com` and verify SPF/DKIM; a contact form may POST the Brevo transactional API, a `mailto:` to the on-domain address is the floor. Reachability is the point — the address must actually deliver. Extends the CANON-011 universal page set; scaffold: `STUDIO_WEBSITE_SCAFFOLD/catalog.json → studioEnforcements.contactRequirement` + `_universal/contact.html.template`.

## Actively CHECK canon — don't just point at it (S183 founder directive)

Referencing the index below is not enough — **every project actively checks Studio Canon and records its posture.** At `/initiate` (mandatory) and on `/start`, run:
```bash
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/check-canon-adoption.mjs --project . --write    # initiate / refresh
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/check-canon-adoption.mjs --project . --suggest  # start (pre-fill safe conformance-backed suggestions)
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/check-canon-adoption.mjs --project . --check    # start (verify current)
```
It reads the **live** `STUDIO_CANON.md` (always current) and maintains `context/CANON_ADOPTION.md` — each ACTIVE canon marked adopted / pending / review / exempt-with-reason. `--suggest` may pre-fill `adopted (suggested)` only from conformance/doctor evidence; judgment canon remain `review`. Walk the remaining `review` rows for your type. A missing/stale adoption file is a doctor finding (`canon-adoption-active`). The canon index below is the *map*; `CANON_ADOPTION.md` is your *checked posture against it*.
