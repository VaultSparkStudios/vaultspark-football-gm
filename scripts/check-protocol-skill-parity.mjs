// check-protocol-skill-parity.mjs — S280 [audit #1]
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS FOR
//
// `docs/SESSION_PROTOCOL.md` is canonical: it is what gets audited, quoted in
// canon, and propagated to 41 repos. But it is not what RUNS. What runs is a
// SKILL.md living outside any repo (`~/.claude/skills/...`, `~/.agents/skills/...`)
// with a git-tracked snapshot under `plugins/studio-os/skills/`. Nothing compared
// the two, so the executable copy could quietly drop a mandated gate and every
// surface would keep reporting health — the omission is invisible from inside the
// session that commits it.
//
// It had. Measured on 2026-08-13 during S280's own `/start`:
//   · `start-canon-sync.mjs` — the protocol calls it a mandatory gate and says
//     "never rely on an agent's remembered canon". Absent from ALL THREE copies of
//     studio-start. That session's `/start` skipped Canon+Ark reconciliation
//     outright, and `tier2-start-canon-sync.mjs` had been failing on exactly this
//     assertion, naming the defect precisely, while the suite red was carried as
//     background noise.
//   · `frontier-capability-radar.mjs` — CANON-049 and AGENTS.md both say "at every
//     /start". Absent. Doctor's `source-fingerprint-court` had drifted to 14.9 days
//     against a 7-day promise.
//
// WHY IT UNDER-REPORTS ON PURPOSE
//
// The first cut of this checker flagged every `scripts/*.mjs` a protocol section
// mentioned. It produced 39 findings, 34 of which were noise: `studio-closeout`
// legitimately delegates by section number ("write-back in canonical order
// (§3.1–3.5)") instead of naming each script, and a skill that points at the
// protocol is not a skill that skips it. Shipping that version would have created
// precisely the over-reporting lint that gets muted — and a muted lint is worse
// than no lint (S275).
//
// So the default is inverted. Only scripts REGISTERED as unconditional gates can
// produce a `gap`, and each registration cites the protocol line that makes it
// unconditional. Everything else the protocol names is reported as `unclassified`:
// not a defect, just an honest statement of what this checker has not been taught
// to rule on. Publishing that denominator is the point — a lint that hides its own
// blind spot is the thing it was built to catch.
//
// CANON-039 INTERNAL-FIRST — checked against the existing `protocol` domain before
// building, and `check-tool-duplication.mjs` flagged all seven of these on the first
// full run, which is the guard working as designed. Each was read, not waved off:
//   · `protocol-doctor.mjs` — the near miss, and the one worth stating precisely. Its
//     line 52 hashes `~/.claude/skills/<n>/SKILL.md` against `~/.agents/skills/<n>/SKILL.md`,
//     i.e. it asks "do the two live copies AGREE WITH EACH OTHER". It never opens
//     SESSION_PROTOCOL. That is orthogonal, not overlapping: in the S280 defect all
//     three copies were byte-identical AND all three were missing both gates, so a
//     copy-vs-copy check reports perfect health on exactly the failure this exists
//     to catch. Agreement is not conformance.
//   · `propagate-protocol-scripts.mjs` — ships protocol scripts to sibling repos; it
//     moves files, it does not evaluate whether a skill invokes them.
//   · `check-protocol-faq-freshness.mjs` — dates a derived FAQ artifact.
//   · `update-protocol-changelog.mjs` — appends protocol history.
//   · `render-protocol-biography.mjs` — narrative rendering of protocol evolution.
//   · `ask-protocol.mjs` — interactive Q&A lookup over protocol text.
//   · `check-mobile-parity.mjs` — collides only on the word "parity"; it is desktop↔
//     mobile UI (CANON-041) and shares no subject with this.
// No existing tool computes protocol-mandate → skill-coverage, so this is a new
// domain rather than a second producer of an existing number (CANON-031).
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/check-protocol-skill-parity.mjs [--json]
// Exit 0 when every REGISTERED gate is present in every skill copy; 1 otherwise.
// `unclassified` never fails the run — it is coverage debt, reported not enforced.
