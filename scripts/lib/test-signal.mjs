// test-signal.mjs — S263. One honest reading of "are the tests green?"
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO KILL
//
// PROJECT_STATUS.json carries two independent test surfaces:
//
//   file-level      testsPassing / testsTotal          owned by refresh-test-count.mjs
//                                                      and test-proof-reconciliation.mjs
//   assertion-level testsAssertionsPassing / ...Total  owned by run-tests.mjs
//
// They are deliberately separate (S160 #4: one shared pair of fields made
// last-writer-wins flip the numbers). But `testsLastRun` — the freshness stamp
// that every consumer renders NEXT TO the file-level counts — was written by
// BOTH. run-tests.mjs stamped `new Date()` on it while refusing to write the
// counts it dates.
//
// The consequence, observed live at S263 start:
//
//   testsPassing 346/346          frozen since 2026-08-01 (commit c302e046)
//   testsLastRun "2026-08-03"     bumped by a RED run on 08-02
//   testsAssertions 2170/2184     RED
//
// So a failing run REFRESHED THE FRESHNESS of a stale green it did not produce.
// The startup brief rendered "✓ Tests 346/346 (2026-08-03)". The doctor `tests`
// probe computes staleness from that same field, so its anti-phantom-green guard
// was reset to zero days old by the very run that failed. Brief and doctor both
// reported green, from one defect, while the suite was red.
//
// THE RULE
//
// A freshness stamp belongs to the producer of the numbers it dates. Beyond that,
// two surfaces measuring the same thing must be RECONCILED, not read
// independently — when a newer assertion-level run contradicts an older
// file-level green, the green is not evidence. Say CONTRADICTED and name both
// sides; never silently prefer the reassuring one (CANON-031).

// ── S283 [audit #2]: was the file-level run BOUNDED? ─────────────────────────
//
// S263 (above) reconciled the two surfaces this module was built for. A third
// one then re-opened the same hole from underneath. Observed live at S283 start:
//
//   testsPassing 384 / testsTotal 384      →  passing === total
//   testsDeferred []                       →  zero deferrals, structurally
//   testsLastRun "2026-08-13"              →  newer than the assertion red
//   testsLastRunMode "… + changed:budget-deferred"
//   testsDeferredNote "… 30 files remained budget-deferred and are not counted green"
//
// The run was bounded — it stopped when a 120s budget ran out — and 30 files were
// never executed. But the ONLY machine-readable deferral field was an empty array,
// so `deferred` computed to 0, `passing === total` held, and the brief rendered
// "✓ Tests 384/384". The truth lived exclusively in prose that nothing parses.
//
// Worse, that same empty array made the bounded run look like a clean supersession:
// a genuine assertion-level red (2551/2561) was dismissed purely because the
// file-level stamp was newer — and the newer thing was the partial run. A signal
// that cannot go red no matter how many files are skipped is not a signal.
//
// So: a bound is a first-class fact. It is read from whichever surface records it,
// it never renders green, and it never supersedes a red. A structured field that
// disagrees with its own prose sibling is reported as the WRITER's defect, because
// that is where it must be fixed — a renderer patch would leave the empty array
// to mislead the next consumer.
