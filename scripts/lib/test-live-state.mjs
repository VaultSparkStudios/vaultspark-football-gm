// test-live-state.mjs — S280 [audit #2]
//
// Some test files legitimately assert against LIVE session state rather than a
// fixture: `tier1-session-lock.mjs` verifies the real `context/.session-lock`
// that `/start` writes. Those files already DECLARE that dependency in a header
// annotation:
//
//     // @integration-live-state context/.session-lock
//
// Until S280 nothing read the annotation. The declared state was simply absent
// whenever no session happened to be open, the test threw, and the runner
// counted it as a FAILURE. Measured on 2026-08-13: the 01:54 automation run
// (no session) recorded `tier1-session-lock` as `exit 1`; the same file run at
// 07:25 with a lock present returned 9/9. Identical code, opposite verdicts,
// decided entirely by whether a human was mid-session.
//
// That number is not private. It is the `Tests` signal on STARTUP_BRIEF, the
// daily briefing, and the nightly self-audit — so the studio published
// "suite RED" on a morning when two of its five reds were phantom.
//
// The fix is NOT a new status class. `run-tests.mjs` already has exactly the
// right one: `env-blocked`, which per CANON-031 is never counted green and
// never counted red. A declared-but-absent precondition is precisely that —
// not a test result at all. This module only answers "which declared paths are
// missing", and both spawn surfaces share it.
//
// Why shared: `run-tests.mjs` and `refresh-test-count.mjs` are the studio's two
// paired test-spawn surfaces, and `run-tests.mjs` carries a standing S205 note
// that they "must not diverge" (the S153/S159 hazard). Putting the parser in
// one place is the whole point — a second copy is the bug.
