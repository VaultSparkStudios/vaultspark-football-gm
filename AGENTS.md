# Project Agent Guide

## Session Protocol (agent-neutral — applies to Claude Code, Codex, any agent)

The canonical execution protocol for every Studio OS session lives in **`docs/SESSION_PROTOCOL.md`** in this repo (propagated from studio-ops).

It covers the 3-command rhythm (`/start` → `/go` → `/closeout`), full protocol for 15 commands, and agent-specific notes for Claude Code + Codex. Both agents execute the same instructions; per-agent branching is flagged explicitly with `IF agent = claude-code:` / `IF agent = codex:`.

See `docs/SKILL_MAP.md` for the one-page command cheatsheet.

This public repository contains deployable project code and public-safe documentation.

Public-safe rule:
- keep deployable code and browser-safe configuration in this repo
- keep internal operating procedures, private planning, secret-handling workflows, and detailed studio process docs in the private Studio OS / ops repository

## IP and Licensing (CANON-008)

All VaultSpark Studios code, content, assets, and designs are **proprietary by default**. All rights are reserved by VaultSpark Studios LLC unless a license is explicitly declared and approved by the Studio Owner.

**Agent rules:**
- Never add a `LICENSE` file with open-source terms unless explicitly instructed by the Studio Owner
- Never label a page, readme, or doc as "open source" for VaultSpark-original work
- Attribution/compliance pages on public sites must use proprietary-first language
- `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md` default: `License: Proprietary — All Rights Reserved, VaultSpark Studios LLC`

**Exceptions (legal obligations — not discretionary):**
Any project forked from a copyleft-licensed upstream must declare its license in `context/DECISIONS.md` and `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md`. Check `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md` for this project's obligations.

Full decision: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` → CANON-008

## Skill & Capability Discovery (CANON-012)

If you (Claude / Codex / subagent / managed agent) need to do something and don't know the right command, **check the Studio capabilities index first** before declaring the task blocked or unknown.

- **Master index:** `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/AGENT_CAPABILITIES.md` — every skill, script, agent role, MCP tool, and credential capability available studio-wide. Auto-regenerated nightly + on closeout.
- **Natural-language lookup:** `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/ops.mjs cap "<intent>"` — describe what you need ("send an email", "deploy to Cloudflare", "check uptime") and it returns the matching capability.
- **Slash-command list (Claude):** `~/.claude/skills/`. **Codex:** `~/.agents/skills/`.
- **Cheatsheet:** `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/SKILL_MAP.md`.

If nothing matches, **file an innovation candidate** (it goes into the next genius list) — do not surface as a human-blocker until you've checked the index and run the elevated-probe step.

---

## Secrets Discovery (CANON-012)

All Studio credentials live in **`vaultspark-studio-ops/secrets/`**. Every project, every agent, every script reads from here. Never read `.env` directly in subprocesses; never assume `process.env.X` is set.

**Before declaring any task "Human Action Required":**

```bash
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/check-secrets.mjs --for <capability>
```

If the capability returns READY → proceed autonomously. If MISSING → check `vaultspark-studio-ops/secrets/CAPABILITY_MAP.json` for the canonical env var names, then run `/intake-credentials` if the founder needs to supply them. The "phantom blocker" pattern (labeling something human-blocked when the credential is already present) is forbidden by canon.

**Resolving a secret in code:**

```js
import { getSecret, resolveCapability, redact } from 'vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/lib/secrets.mjs';
const key = await getSecret('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', 'stripe.checkout');
console.log(redact(`Using ${key}`));
```

**Stripe Agent Payments** (autonomous spend on behalf of agents — ad spend, domain renewal, infra top-up): use capability `stripe.agent-payments` with built-in spend-cap. Reference: https://stripe.com/blog/giving-agents-the-ability-to-pay · Audit log: `secrets/.payments.log`.

Full protocol: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/SECRETS_PROTOCOL.md`.

---

## Sitemap Standard (CANON-011 · public-facing projects only)

If this project's `audience` is `public-*`, every page in `docs/PROJECT_SITEMAP_STANDARD.md` must exist and pass the quality bars (LCP <1.8s · CWV green · CSP strict · `/agents.json` · `/.well-known/llms.txt` · sitemap.xml). Reference exemplars: vaultsparkstudios.com · vorn.app · mindframe.app.

Audit: `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/check-sitemap-compliance.mjs --project <slug>`.

Project must score ≥8/10 before flipping to SPARKED. `app-release-gate` enforces.

---

## CANON-019 — Founder-Action Discipline (CDR-S126.1, MANDATORY)

**Problem this canon fixes:** agents repeatedly label tasks as "Founder Action Required" or "Human Blocker" when the work is actually agent-attemptable. Pattern observed across multiple repos and sessions. **Default behavior MUST flip: try first, label blocked only after evidence of attempt.**

**Hard gate — before any task is labeled `Human Action Required`, `[BLOCKER]`, `FOUNDER ACTION`, or `human-blocked`, you MUST have run AND logged:**

```bash
# 1. Secrets discovery (always)
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/check-secrets.mjs --for <capability>

# 2. Elevated/admin probe (always)
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/ops.mjs blocker-preflight

# 3. If credential is READY → execute the action yourself using the secrets gateway
# 4. If admin probe reveals agent-attemptable path → execute it
```

**Reserve `Human Action Required` ONLY for:** hardware key enrollment · provider dashboard signup · billing/payment confirmation · destructive ops explicitly gated by CANON (force-push to main, npm publish, prod DB drop).

**Everything else is agent work.** This includes: applying migrations · running deploys (`wrangler deploy`, `vercel deploy`, `gcloud run deploy`) · setting secrets in providers (`wrangler secret put`, `gh secret set`, `gcloud secrets versions add`) · creating workflows · scaffolding files · running `--apply` flags on scripted migrations · enrolling in API allowlists via API calls.

**Closeout enforcement (CANON-019):** every `/closeout` runs:
```bash
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/enforce-blocker-discipline.mjs
```
Verdict `discipline-gap` → warns founder + lists violating items. With `--strict` flag → blocks closeout. Log persisted to `portfolio/BLOCKER_DISCIPLINE_LOG.ndjson`.

**The phantom-blocker pattern is forbidden.** If you find yourself typing `FOUNDER ACTION` or `human-blocked` without two commits showing `check-secrets` + `blocker-preflight` evidence in the last hour, **STOP and try the action yourself.**

---

## Elevated-access protocol (S113 — apply migrations yourself)

When a sprint deliverable lists "Founder action needed" steps that are **scripted** (`wrangler deploy`, `wrangler secret put`, `gh workflow run`, `node scripts/migrate-*.mjs --apply`, `hcloud …`, `gcloud …`, etc.), the agent **must execute them itself** using the relevant gateway capability — not leave them for the founder.

**Reserve "Human Action Required" only for:**
- Hardware key enrollment (FIDO2, Yubikey)
- Provider dashboard signup / account creation
- Billing / payment confirmation
- Destructive operations explicitly gated by CANON (force-push to main, npm publish, etc.)

Safe scripted migrations are agent work, not founder work. The founder-twin auto-approves the safe patterns; deny patterns still gate at the founder. Use `node scripts/twin-ask.mjs <Tool> <input>` for cross-agent verdict (Codex) or rely on the PreToolUse hook (Claude Code).

---

## Founder-Twin auto-approval (S113 — cross-agent)

Both Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT-style CLI agents, subagents, and managed agents consult one shared auto-approval model. Same brain, same history, same audit trail — patterns learned by one agent benefit every agent. Founder-Twin is not optional ceremony; it is the Studio's approval memory and safety filter.

**Codex usage** (no native PreToolUse hook — call explicitly before risky commands):

```bash
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/twin-ask.mjs Bash "<command>"
# exit 0 = approve · exit 1 = ask · exit 2 = deny
```

**Claude Code:** wired automatically via `~/.claude/settings.json` → `hooks.PreToolUse`.

Disable per-session: `export TWIN_DISABLED=1`. Full spec: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/TWIN_PROTOCOL.md`.

---

## Broad Approval + Non-Malicious Verification (CANON-024, MANDATORY)

Founder direction: agents should not ask for repeated piecemeal approvals when one bounded command-family approval can safely cover the work. Agents must request broader approvals when escalation is necessary, and must verify more aggressively that proposed actions are non-malicious before running them.

**Approval-scope rule.**
- Prefer one persistent approval for a safe command family over repeated one-off prompts.
- Codex: when requesting escalation, include a reasonable `prefix_rule` for the command family whenever the command is repeatable and bounded (for example `["git", "push"]`, `["npm", "test"]`, `["node", "scripts/run-doctor.mjs"]`).
- Claude Code / hook-driven agents: let Founder-Twin auto-approve learned safe patterns, and record asks/denies so future agents inherit the learning.
- Never request broad approval for destructive commands, arbitrary interpreters, `curl | sh`, heredocs, commands with secret material, force-pushes, package publishes, production DB destructive SQL, billing/payment execution, or legal/public-promise changes. Ask narrowly for those.

**Non-malicious action preflight.** Before any side-effecting, networked, privileged, cross-repo, production, dependency, payment, or secret-touching action, verify:
1. **Intent:** the action directly serves the current user/studio objective.
2. **Scope:** target repo/path/host/account is explicit; recursive writes/deletes resolve inside the intended directory.
3. **Trust:** dependencies/downloads pass Obelisk Package Trust (CANON-023); external endpoints and remotes are expected.
4. **Secrets:** credentials are resolved only through the secrets gateway; no raw secrets are printed, pasted, or logged.
5. **Blast radius:** expected writes/mutations are named; rollback or recovery path is known for risky changes.
6. **Twin verdict:** run Founder-Twin (`twin-ask` for Codex/ChatGPT agents, PreToolUse hook for Claude) unless the tool is purely read-only and already safe-listed.

If Founder-Twin returns `deny`, stop. If it returns `ask`, request one bounded approval for the action class, not a stream of individual repeats. If the twin is unavailable, log the gap in the session handoff and fall back to the narrowest safe founder confirmation.

---

## Universal `/audit` + `/implement` (S113)

Two project-agnostic skills for both agents:

- `/audit` — genius-level 9-axis project audit → writes `docs/AUDIT_<date>.md`
- `/implement` — read latest `AUDIT_*.md` and ship every item in optimal-efficiency order

Project-type aware via `portfolio/PROJECT_REGISTRY.json` → `type`. Personal-scope canonical at `~/.claude/skills/` (Claude) and `~/.agents/skills/` (Codex mirror, auto-synced).

---

## Studio Website Reference Scaffold (D-S119.3)

Before scaffolding any public-facing website page (home, auth, dashboard, marketing, legal, etc), agent MUST consult the canonical catalog at:

- `vaultspark-studio-ops/portfolio/STUDIO_WEBSITE_SCAFFOLD/catalog.json` — live catalog (auto-refreshed nightly)
- `vaultspark-studio-ops/portfolio/STUDIO_WEBSITE_SCAFFOLD/patterns.json` — derived consensus patterns
- `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_WEBSITE_SCAFFOLD_PLAN.md` — architecture + rationale

**Workflow.** (1) Read `catalog.json` — see how vaultsparkstudios.com, joinvorn.com, usemindframe.com (and others) handle menu, auth, footer, page list. (2) Read `patterns.json` — use the consensus pattern unless this project's `context/SOUL.md` justifies a deviation. (3) If deviating, log it in `context/DECISIONS.md` with rationale. (4) For ANY public signup flow, wire the **Vault SSO contract** (see `docs/VAULT_SSO_CONTRACT.md`). Free Studio membership is auto-granted on signup unless user opts out.

**Enforcements (non-negotiable for public projects):** branding line per type (CANON-006), footer copyright `© 2026 VaultSpark Studios LLC. All rights reserved.`, required legal pages `/privacy` + `/terms`, Vault SSO call on signup-success when `vault.sso` capability is provisioned.

Refresh manually: `node vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/scrape-studio-websites.mjs`.

---

## Max Plan First (CANON-015 · CDR-S120.1)

Default to **Claude Max Plan** for every new Claude-using feature. Direct Anthropic **API** calls require:
1. **Feasibility check** — confirm Max Plan can't deliver this (e.g. true rate-limit, automation-only context).
2. **Cost estimate** — projected monthly $ with usage assumptions.
3. **Founder approval** logged in `context/DECISIONS.md` with `[API]` tag.

**Enforcement.** Every script making direct Anthropic HTTP calls (`api.anthropic.com`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, or model-router bypass) must appear in `portfolio/APPROVED_API_SCRIPTS.json`. Doctor probe `api-allowlist` greps `scripts/` for direct usage and fails on unregistered callers.

**Existing API code is grandfathered** — only new adoption requires approval.

---

## Free-Build Bias (CANON-017 · CDR-S120.1)

Default integration choices live in `docs/INTEGRATION_PREFERENCES.md`. Before adopting any **new** SaaS that isn't the canonical free choice, fill `docs/templates/BUILD_VS_BUY.md` and get founder sign-off. Lock-in score ≥6 requires explicit founder override.

**Doctor probe `build-vs-buy-discipline`** fails when a `[INTEGRATION]` decision in `DECISIONS.md` doesn't link a `BUILD_VS_BUY` record.

---

## Studio Ark — Cross-Repo Transport (CANON-018)

Every Studio repo's `/start` automatically drains the Studio Ark inbox (step 1.8). Cargo addressed to this repo's `slug` (or `*` broadcast) appears in `.cache/ark-inbox.json`; the `╔══ ARK STATUS ══╗` tile in the startup brief surfaces depth + sig health.

**Sending cargo:**

```bash
# Share a learned pattern with the fleet
node scripts/ark.mjs ship --type pattern-share --to '*' \
  --payload '{"pattern":"win-spawn-quirk","context":"node child_process on Windows","solution":"use absolute paths","tags":["windows","node"]}'

# Ask another repo a question
node scripts/ark.mjs ship --type repo-question --to mindframe \
  --payload '{"question":"how do you handle X","context":"working on similar feature","replyTo":"my-slug"}'

# Hand off intent + context to another repo's agent
node scripts/ark.mjs ship --type agent-handoff --to vorn \
  --payload '{"intent":"finish auth refactor","openFiles":["src/auth.ts"],"recentDecisions":["use vault-sso"]}'
```

**Rules:**
- Never write directly to another repo's files. Ship cargo instead (CANON-018).
- Receipts are auto-emitted on drain — don't ship them manually.
- Producer allowlist enforced in `portfolio/ark/MANIFEST.json`. Most types are open; `canon-update` + `phantom-blocker-fix` are studio-ops only.
- Full design: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_ARK.md`.

---

## Obelisk (CANON-021) — Studio-wide trust + capability protocol

**Canonical name:** `Obelisk`. Never use `VaultKey`, `VaultPass`, `Vaultify`, `iVault`, `myVault`, or bare `Vault`.

**What Obelisk is.** A Studio-wide trust layer above existing standards (TLS, WebAuthn, TOTP, OAuth). Passkey-first identity + TOTP fallback + device trust + signed intent receipts + short-lived capability grants + MCP firewall + prompt firewall + secret/OAuth broker + Sigstore-style supply-chain signing + post-quantum readiness via standards.

**What Obelisk is NOT.** Not a password manager. Not a TLS replacement. Not custom cryptography. Never market as "unhackable" or "quantum-proof" — approved language is "post-quantum migration-ready."

**Per-project requirement.** Every project must declare its Obelisk posture in `context/OBELISK_ADOPTION.md`. Posture values: `not-applicable` · `pending` · `phase-0-declared` · `phase-1-pilot` · `phase-2-mcp` · `phase-3-ops-integrated` · `phase-4-public-app-migrated`.

**Mandatory rules for agents.**
- Never bring raw secrets into agent prompts — use capability grants via `scripts/lib/secrets.mjs::getSecret(cap)` (CANON-012 wrap)
- Never register an unsigned MCP server for privileged actions
- Never make a production mutation without an intent receipt
- Cross-repo Obelisk rollout MUST flow through Studio Ark (CANON-018) — never directly edit sibling repos
- For founder/internal tools: passkey-first after Hub Phase 1; password-primary auth is deprecated

**Capability surface (declared in studio-ops `secrets/CAPABILITY_MAP.json`).**
- `obelisk.identity.verify` — WebAuthn relying-party credentials
- `obelisk.grant.issue` — TOTP seed storage
- `obelisk.receipt.write` — intent-receipt signing key
- `obelisk.mcp.register` — MCP registry signature key

**References.**
- Full spec (Hub source-of-truth): `vaultspark-studio-hub/docs/OBELISK_PROTOCOL_PLAN.md`
- Studio-ops execution mirror + appendix: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/OBELISK_PROTOCOL_PLAN.md`
- Canon entry: `docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` → CANON-021
- Inventory script: `node scripts/check-obelisk-posture.mjs` (run from any repo)

---

## Obelisk Package Trust (CANON-023) — verify before install/download

Before adding a dependency, choosing between package options, downloading an archive/binary/model file, or following an agent-suggested install command, run the package trust gate first:

```bash
node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/package-trust.mjs --package <name>@<version>
```

From Studio Ops:

```bash
node scripts/ops.mjs package-trust --package <name>@<version>
```

**Mandatory rules for agents.**
- Do not run `npm install`, `pnpm add`, `yarn add`, `pip install`, `cargo install`, `curl | sh`, `Invoke-WebRequest`, or browser downloads until the package/artifact has an `APPROVE` or explicitly resolved `REVIEW` decision.
- Treat `BLOCK` as a hard stop. Pick another option.
- Treat raw GitHub zips, shortened URLs, executable installers, shell scripts, model weights, browser extensions, and archives as quarantined until checksum/signature/source are verified.
- Run `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/scan-npm-supply-chain.mjs --json` after lockfile changes and before push/closeout.
- Existing valid provenance is not enough by itself; compromised publisher workflows can still produce signed malicious packages.

**References.**
- Protocol: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/OBELISK_PACKAGE_TRUST_PROTOCOL.md`
- Gate: `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/package-trust.mjs`
- IOC scanner: `node ../vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/scan-npm-supply-chain.mjs`

---

## Agent Co-Authoring Protocol (CANON-022)

When two or more agents work on a shared concern (canon, protocol, schema, ecosystem-wide change), responsibilities split into four roles:

- **Designer** — owns the source-of-truth document + architecture decisions (e.g. Hub for Obelisk · founder for SOUL · IGNIS for scoring rubric)
- **Mechanizer** — owns canon elevation · capability declarations · doctor probes · templates (studio-ops for every canon)
- **Propagator** — owns cross-repo rollout via CANON-016 + CANON-018 (studio-ops exclusively)
- **Implementer** — owns code that uses the protocol primitives (each project per its medium)

**Coordination primitives (Ark cargo).**
- **`working-on`** (TTL 6h) — advertises "I'm actively editing this surface; coordinate before conflicting." Other agents drain + defer.
- **`content-acked`** (TTL 168h) — explicit acknowledgment that received content was READ + APPLIED, not just drained. Closes the diagnose→apply loop that `cargo-receipt` leaves open.
- **`registry-change`** (TTL 168h) — broadcasts PROJECT_REGISTRY mutations (new-repo, status-flip, medium-change, field-update, repo-archived) so all agents stay in sync without polling.
- **`security-protocol-update`** (no TTL) — Obelisk security/auth/capability protocol decision broadcast. Studio-ops + Hub only as producers.

**Mandatory rules for agents.**
- Mechanizer NEVER modifies Designer's source-of-truth file directly; ship Ark suggestion cargo instead
- Designer NEVER writes propagation logic — ship cargo and trust the Propagator
- For any cross-agent shared surface, subscribe to `working-on` + `content-acked` cargo for that surface
- Every adoption file declares `coAuthoringRole: designer|mechanizer|propagator|implementer`
- Doctor probe `cross-repo-sync-health` warns on Ark RTT > 24h between active sibling agents

**Worked example.** Obelisk Phase 0 (S119): Hub designed + broadcast (Designer) → studio-ops elevated CANON-021 + 6 capabilities + doctor probe + inventory script + brief tile (Mechanizer) → studio-ops broadcast canon-update to 27 repos via CANON-016 (Propagator) → future `VaultSparkStudios/obelisk` repo will own implementation (Implementer).

- Cargo manifest: `vaultspark-studio-ops/portfolio/ark/MANIFEST.json`

## Free-Tier Cost Discipline (CANON-029 · CDR-S138.3, MANDATORY pre-revenue)

Every Studio project's free tier MUST be **per-user cost-neutral to the studio at 1000+ users**. Features that consume per-user variable studio cost (LLM API calls without BYOK, image/audio/video gen, transcription, transactional email beyond hard ceiling, vector DB writes, per-user paid compute, per-user paid monitoring, metered third-party APIs) MUST be gated to paid tiers OR served via no-cost-to-studio patterns.

**Approved free-tier patterns:**
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** — user supplies provider API key; we orchestrate. Default for LLM features on free plans. Reference: Velaxis.
- **Local-only compute** — browser-side, localStorage / IndexedDB.
- **Cached / static** — pre-computed at build, served from CDN / edge KV.
- **Trial-ceiling** — N free uses lifetime, hard 429 with upgrade prompt (NOT degraded experience).
- **Stay-in-free-band** — Cloudflare Workers free 100K/day, Supabase free 500MB, Hetzner CX22 $5/mo flat.

**Forbidden on free tier (always paid):** studio-paid LLM API · image/audio/video gen · transcription · transactional email beyond hard ceiling · vector DB writes beyond free band · per-user paid compute · per-user paid monitoring · per-call metered third-party APIs.

**Implementation gate (MANDATORY every project):**
- `context/PROJECT_STATUS.json` declares `freeTierCostStatus`: `cost-neutral | BYOK | trial-ceiling | paid-only | exempt-internal | AUDIT-PENDING` (default).
- `app-release-gate` blocks SPARKED flip if `AUDIT-PENDING`.
- Free-tier feature flags enforce gate **server-side** (never trust client).
- Audit doc: `docs/FREE_TIER_AUDIT_<date>.md` (template: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/FREE_TIER_AUDIT_2026-05-22_PORTFOLIO.md`).

**Approved exceptions (narrow, log in DECISIONS.md):** time-boxed acquisition burn with named $-cap + kill date · `audience: internal` projects · copyleft fork obligations.

**Reference good patterns:** Seamline `lib/tiers.ts` (per-feature cost comments + server-side enforcement) · Velaxis (BYOK + no backend) · Vorn `llm-gateway.ts` (sophisticated embedding/semantic/prompt caching for paid tier).

**Rationale.** Zero revenue + only costs. 1000 free users × $0.05/user/day LLM × 5 SPARKED projects = $7.5K/mo burn before $1 of revenue. Pre-revenue, no general override.

Full canon: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` → CANON-029.

---

## Acronym Expansion in Public Content (CANON-030 · CDR-S144.3, MANDATORY)

In any **user-facing or content-facing** surface, an acronym MUST NOT appear alone on first use. Spell the term out with the acronym in parentheses — **Full Term (ACRONYM)** — then the bare acronym is fine for the rest of that surface. Acronym-only naming of a content item or feature is **forbidden unless explicitly approved** by the Studio Owner.

- ✓ "Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)" → "BYOK" thereafter · "Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)" · "Self-Improvement Loop (SIL)".
- ✗ A button/heading/pricing-card/tooltip whose only label is an unexpanded acronym.

**Applies to:** website copy, marketing pages, pricing cards, headings, buttons, tooltips, empty/error states, feature & content-item names, public README feature/pricing sections, announcements, store listings, in-app help & onboarding.

**Exempt:** internal engineering artifacts (code identifiers, commit messages, `context/`+`docs/` internal Markdown, agent prompts, tests, logs); `audience: internal` projects' internal surfaces; Studio-Owner-approved brand terms (log the approval).

**Why.** Acronym-only labels make content opaque to anyone who doesn't already hold the jargon, raising the comprehension cost of every surface. Expanding on first use costs almost nothing and makes pages self-explaining.

**Gate.** New user-facing copy follows the rule by default; `app-release-gate` flags acronym-only labels (unapproved acronym-only content/feature names block the public-facing review item until expanded or approved). Approved exceptions logged per-project in `DECISIONS.md` / `CREATIVE_DIRECTION_RECORD.md`.

Full canon: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` → CANON-030.

---

## Observability Honesty (CANON-031 · D-S144.5, MANDATORY)

Every metric, probe, dashboard, score, and status surface MUST tell the truth:
1. **Derive from source-of-truth** — compute from authoritative data, never a cached/derived copy that can silently lag.
2. **Self-validate** — assert coherence and fail loud when incoherent; never render a plausible-looking lie.
3. **Exempt self-reference** — a scanner/probe must not flag its own report/source.
4. **Separate sender-controllable from external** — a cross-repo SLO must not report critical for what the measured party can't fix in its own session (dormant recipient ≠ sender failure → directed nudge, not red).
5. **No phantom green, no phantom red** — never fake compliance to clear a blocker; never leave a structurally-unclearable false blocker. Genuine-but-foreign blockers stay honest-red and are queued to the owner.
6. **Validate exit codes directly** — shell pipes mask exit codes; check the producing command's status.

Full canon: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` → CANON-031.

**Write-time SIL invariant (S154 · extends CANON-031.2):** whenever any agent writes `context/PROJECT_STATUS.json`, it MUST hold `silScore := sum(silCategoriesV3)` with every category in 0..100. Write through the shared helper when present:

```bash
node scripts/lib/write-project-status.mjs --check   # validate (exit 1 on violation)
node scripts/lib/write-project-status.mjs --fix     # recompute silScore + clamp categories
```

At closeout, run `--check` after the status write-back; a violation is a closeout blocker. This root-fixes the silScore/sum drift class (S143: sparkfunnel drift, website categories >100).

---

## Build-Optimal for Flagships (CANON-032 · D-S144.6 / CDR-S144.4)

For **flagship / sophisticated products** (Studio-Owner-designated), the default is **build-optimal**: examine the full option space (all stacks, alternatives, combined elements) and choose for long-term scalability, maximum UI/UX, and maximum fulfillment of the product's potential — don't inherit a ceiling-limiting constraint without a documented, product-justified reason.

- Any constraint that materially limits a flagship's ceiling (interactivity, scale, personalization, UX) needs an explicit rationale (security/privacy/cost/legal) in that project's `DECISIONS.md` + a **revisit trigger**.
- Prefer constraints compatible with sophistication (strict nonce-based CSP + modern interactive frontend) over blanket restrictions (no-JavaScript) that cap the ceiling.
- **No contradiction with CANON-029/013:** cost discipline gates the *free tier's variable cost*; build-optimal governs the *product's architecture ceiling* (core + paid). CANON-013 low-cost defaults remain for ordinary projects; flagships are the override lane.

Full canon: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/STUDIO_CANON.md` → CANON-032.

---

## Launch Announcement Discipline (CANON-033 · D-S144.7)

A flip to **SPARKED** requires an **executed announcement plan** — silent launches waste the cheapest growth lever. Not "done" until the product is told to the world.

- ≥1 public channel identified + executed (community/subreddit, social, Studio Hub feature, changelog, directory listing).
- One-line value prop + link, consistent with CANON-006 (branding) + CANON-030 (spell out acronyms).
- Recorded in `DECISIONS.md` / `LAUNCH_*.md` with date + channels.
- `app-release-gate` checks for an announcement plan; the deployed-unannounced detector surfaces SPARKED/deployed projects with none as a growth task.
- Exceptions (log per-project): `audience: internal` · intentional stealth window with named reveal date · dependency-gated (announce on unblock).

## Browser Experience Excellence (CANON-034 · D-S149.4, MANDATORY)

Any VaultSpark project with a browser or website surface treats the browser experience as first-class. The browser/website version must never be below a native/mobile app version; it should usually be the most expansive, feature-rich, immersive version of the product, while native apps adapt the same ambition to mobile-native ergonomics.

Rules:
- Desktop browser, tablet/mobile browser, and any native/mobile app surface must be reviewed for feature parity, responsiveness, polish, accessibility, and interaction depth.
- Mobile browser is not a fallback. Public websites/apps must be extremely mobile-friendly and mobile-responsive; core workflows, dashboards, games/tools, auth, payments, and navigation must work cleanly at common mobile widths.
- If a mobile/native app has capabilities the browser lacks, document the rationale in `DECISIONS.md` and add a catch-up plan or explicit approved exception.
- A browser surface that is less capable than the mobile app blocks SPARKED/release approval unless the Studio Owner approves and records the exception.
- CANON-029 still applies: advanced browser features with variable studio cost must be BYOK, trial-ceiling, paid-only, cached/static, or otherwise cost-neutral.

## Unified Skill Brief (CANON-035 candidate · S141)

Every founder-facing skill — `/start`, `/audit`, `/implement`, `/closeout`, `/go` — produces its output through ONE shared library. Same 95-col frame, same voice rules, same schema. Different `kind` flips score labels; nothing else moves.

**Library:** `vaultspark-studio-ops/scripts/lib/skill-brief.mjs`
**Spec:** `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/SKILL_BRIEF_SPEC.md`
**Closeout-specific:** `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/CLOSEOUT_BRIEF_SPEC.md`
**Visual mock:** `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/CLOSEOUT_BRIEF_MOCK.md`

**Five canonical brief kinds:**

| Kind | Skill | Left score | Right score |
|---|---|---|---|
| `orientation` | /start | Context Readiness | Cross-Repo Urgency |
| `audit` | /audit | Combined Priority | Innovation Density |
| `plan` | /implement | Effort Shippability | Execution Confidence |
| `closeout` | /closeout | Project Impact | Ecosystem Impact |
| `sprint` | /go | Round Velocity | Round Quality |

**Per-item required fields:** `id`, `slug`, `title`, `axis`, `leftScore` (1–10), `rightScore` (1–10), `insight` (2–3 sentences, voice-driven, no buzzwords), `evidence`.

**Voice rules for `insight`** (apply universally):
- 2–3 sentences max
- Lead with what changed in plain English; optional second/third = why it matters or what compounds
- Warm-confident voice, slight wit OK when honest
- Forbidden words: leveraged · best-in-class · stakeholder · synergies · robust · seamless
- Forbidden openers: "This implementation/feature/change..."
- No process narration · no emoji inside `insight`

**Cross-agent invocation:**
- Claude Code: skill bodies import `scripts/lib/skill-brief.mjs` directly
- Codex: `node -e "import('./scripts/lib/skill-brief.mjs').then(m => console.log(m.render(JSON.parse(process.argv[1]))))" '<json>'`
- ChatGPT custom GPTs: studio-ops MCP tool `skill_brief_render({ brief })`
- Managed agents: outcome rubric requires brief JSON; harness invokes renderer

If your project doesn't yet produce briefs at session boundaries, the next `/closeout` will queue propagation. No agent invents its own format.

## SIL v5.0 (CANON-030 candidate · S141)

Studio Improvement Loop scoring expands from 1000 max (v3) → **2000 max + ×1.15 halo = 2300** (v5). Three tiers:

- **Base** (10 categories × 100 = 1000, always-on) — functional/aligned/healthy
- **Depth** (5 categories × 100 = 500, unlock at base ≥ 700) — good citizen of the studio
- **Mastery** (5 categories × 100 = 500, unlock at base+depth ≥ 1200) — doing things only this studio can

Mastery categories: Studio Tooling Adoption · Proprietary Surface + IP Posture · Operational Excellence · Stakeholder Value Loop · Anti-Fragility.

Decay: −2%/week per stale category. Halo: +0.5%/gene · +1%/sidecar · +0.3%/importer · +2%/canon (max ×1.15).

Full proposal: `vaultspark-studio-ops/docs/SIL_V5_PROPOSAL.md`. Dual-render v3+v5 begins after canon approval. Library to build: `scripts/lib/sil-v5.mjs`.
