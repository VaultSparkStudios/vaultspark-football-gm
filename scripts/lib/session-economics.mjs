// session-economics.mjs — S175. The shared engine that makes a /goal session
// SATURATE its budget instead of stopping at "one objective done".
//
// THE PROBLEM (founder, S175): Codex /goal sessions finish in 4-10 minutes and
// waste their startup context. Root cause is structural, not behavioral: Claude
// Code's /goal sets a Stop HOOK that BLOCKS termination until a condition holds,
// while Codex's /goal stop-condition (SESSION_PROTOCOL §2A.3) is "stop when the
// one bounded objective is verified" — a completion stop, so it terminates early.
//
// THE FIX: one shared, agent-neutral set of pure predicates that both harnesses
// consult, turning every /goal stop-condition from "completion-of-one" into
// "saturation-of-budget". Claude's Stop hook and Codex's session-floor loop both
// call sessionFloorVerdict(); the answer is identical because the math is here,
// once. (Same "N surfaces, one shared predicate" discipline as S174 ownership.)
//
// Pure + injectable — no I/O, no clocks. scripts/session-floor.mjs wires the live
// data sources (context-meter, skill-cost ledger, genius-list cache); this module
// is the math and is the unit-tested source of truth.

// Context-meter verdict thresholds (mirror scripts/context-meter.mjs semantics).

// boots (~25-40k: brief render + doctor) and ships almost nothing has a low
