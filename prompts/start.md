# ── START ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Use this when the user says only `start`.

## Phase 0 — Mode Declaration

Before reading any files, determine session mode:

| Mode | Trigger | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| **BUILDER MODE** | Default (no qualifier) | Deep work on this project only |
| **FOUNDER MODE** | User says "start: founder mode" | Cross-project strategy; reads STUDIO_BRAIN.md first |

In **Builder Mode:** read only project files. Skip STUDIO_BRAIN.md unless a specific studio flag
is relevant to this session.

In **Founder Mode:** read `portfolio/STUDIO_BRAIN.md` first for studio-wide context, then
proceed with project files.

---

## Phase 1 — Initiation Type Detection

Check `context/SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md`:

| Condition | Type | Action |
|---|---|---|
| File missing or no dated entries | **A — Bootstrap** | Follow `prompts/initiate.md` — do not proceed with Phase 2 |
| 1 entry labeled "Bootstrap Baseline" / "Foundation Baseline" and core files are still template-only | **B — Foundation** | Follow `prompts/initiate.md` Section B |
| 2+ dated entries with real scores | **C — Returning** | Continue with Phase 2 |

---

## Phase 2 — Load Context

Read in this exact order. Do not skip or reorder.

| # | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `AGENTS.md` | Role rules, enforcement, session aliases |
| 2 | `context/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` | What the project is and why it exists |
| 3 | `context/SOUL.md` | Creative identity and non-negotiables |
| 4 | `context/BRAIN.md` | Strategic mental model and heuristics |
| 5 | `context/CURRENT_STATE.md` | Live snapshot of what exists |
| 6 | `context/DECISIONS.md` | Key decisions with rationale |
| 7 | `context/TASK_BOARD.md` | Now / Next / Blocked / Later tasks |
| 8 | `context/LATEST_HANDOFF.md` | Authoritative handoff from last session |
| 9 | `context/SELF_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md` — **header only** | Rolling Status block: sparkline, averages, last scores. No need to read full entry history. |
| 10 | Task-specific files | Only after all above are read |

**Founder Mode only:** Also read `portfolio/STUDIO_BRAIN.md` (read between steps 9 and 10).

---

## Phase 3 — SIL Escalation Check

After reading the SIL Rolling Status header:

- Note the sparkline — is the 5-session trajectory ↑ ↓ flat?
- Note rolling averages — which category is the lowest? Flag if any avg is below 5.0
- Identify any `[SIL]` items on TASK_BOARD not yet actioned
- **If a `[SIL]` item was skipped 2+ sessions → escalate to Now on TASK_BOARD and flag in brief**
- Surface the top unactioned brainstorm idea from the last SIL entry

**Studio benchmarking (no extra reads required):**
If STUDIO_BRAIN.md has been read (Founder Mode), note in brief:
> Studio avg SIL: [X]/50 · This project last session: [X]/50 [↑↓→ vs studio avg]

---

## Phase 4 — Startup Rules

- Treat repo files as source of truth — not prior chat memory
- Do not edit code during startup unless user immediately asks for implementation
- Use `context/LATEST_HANDOFF.md` as the active handoff source
- Treat any other handoff docs as historical context only
- Note any assumptions before acting on them
- **If resuming from a compacted/interrupted session:** check whether the prior session's human
  direction was recorded in `docs/CREATIVE_DIRECTION_RECORD.md`. If the last CDR entry predates
  work described in LATEST_HANDOFF.md, flag the gap in the startup brief and recover it at
  next closeout.

## Phase 5 — Output: Startup Brief

Reply using this exact structure:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  STARTUP BRIEF — {Project Name}
  {YYYY-MM-DD} · Session {N} · {BUILDER / FOUNDER MODE}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  IDENTITY     {type} · {status} · {owner}
  STATE        {current phase and overall health}
  PRIORITIES   Now: {task} · Next: {task}
  CONSTRAINTS  {key constraints or limits}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  WHERE WE LEFT OFF  (Session {N-1})
  Shipped    {N improvements across N groups — group1, group2, ...}
             {or: "N tasks completed" if no improvement groups defined}
  Tests      {N passing (N core / N server / N client) · delta: +N/-N}
             {or: "N/A" if project has no test suite}
  Deploy     {deployed to {env} · auto-deploy active / manual / N/A}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  LAST AUDIT   {total}/50 · {date}
  SPARKLINE    {▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█} (last 5 sessions, oldest→newest)

  Dev Health        {n}/10  {↑↓→}  3-avg: {n.n}
  Creative Align    {n}/10  {↑↓→}  3-avg: {n.n}
  Momentum          {n}/10  {↑↓→}  3-avg: {n.n}
  Engagement        {n}/10  {↑↓→}  3-avg: {n.n}
  Process Quality   {n}/10  {↑↓→}  3-avg: {n.n}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  VELOCITY     Last session: {N} tasks · Trend: {↑↓→}
  DEBT         {→ stable / ↑ growing / ↓ shrinking}
  NEXT MOVE    {specific recommended action}
  BLOCKERS     {open blockers or "None"}
  [SIL] FLAGS  {escalated items or "None"}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  IGNIS INSIGHT
  {One synthesised observation from portfolio/IGNIS_CORE.md
   specific to this project — e.g. velocity trend, engagement
   gap, creative drift signal, or stall pattern warning.
   Write "— insufficient data" if no project entry exists yet.}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**WHERE WE LEFT OFF** data comes from `context/LATEST_HANDOFF.md` — the closeout protocol
writes it there. If no prior session exists, omit the section entirely.

**IGNIS INSIGHT** data comes from `portfolio/IGNIS_CORE.md` — read only the project-specific
section (search for the project slug). Do not read the full file. If the file does not exist
or has no entry for this project, write "— insufficient data for project-specific insight."

---

## Phase 6 — Session Intent Declaration

After delivering the startup brief, ask:

> **"What is the primary goal for this session?"** (one sentence)

Log the declared intent in `context/LATEST_HANDOFF.md` under a `Session Intent:` field at the top.
This is checked and logged at closeout.
