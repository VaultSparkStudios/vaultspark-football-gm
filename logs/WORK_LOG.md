# Work Log

## 2026-05-27 — Audit implementation sprint closeout

- Restored local Studio startup/blocker automation by adding the helper modules imported by `render-startup-brief.mjs` and `blocker-preflight.mjs`.
- Added GameSession lookup indexes for teams, active players, retired players, draft picks, and team rosters, then routed roster, profile, trade, waiver, and free-agent paths through the indexed helpers where appropriate.
- Replaced browser local API simulation job `Math.random()` suffixes with deterministic clock-plus-counter IDs.
- Added targeted regression coverage for Studio protocol scripts, lookup-index mutation flows, and deterministic job IDs.
- Verification passed for targeted tests and syntax checks; full `npm test` exceeded both 5-minute and 15-minute command timeouts.

## 2026-05-27 — Codex startup reliability closeout

- Added project-local Codex launch wrappers for Football GM so this repo can start Codex with `--disable apps` without disabling Apps globally across the Studio portfolio.
- Verified the wrapper path with a fresh `codex exec --ephemeral --sandbox read-only` turn.
- Aligned package metadata with the proprietary rights posture documented in `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md`.

This public repo no longer carries the detailed internal work log. Internal session-by-session execution detail is maintained privately.
